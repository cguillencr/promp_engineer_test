Llama3 8B Instruct

### Input: 
What are the most effective strategies to combat climate change?
Expert 1: Environmental Scientist
Expert 2: Policy Maker
Expert 3: Economist
Organize the entire process in a markdown table format.

### Output:
Here is the organized process in a markdown table format:

**Combating Climate Change: A Comprehensive Approach**

| **Strategy** | **Description** | **Expert** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transition to Renewable Energy** | Increase use of solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels | Environmental Scientist |
| **Energy Efficiency** | Improve building insulation, windows, and appliances to reduce energy consumption | Environmental Scientist |
| **Electrify Transportation** | Promote adoption of electric vehicles and public transportation | Environmental Scientist |
| **Carbon Capture and Storage** | Develop and deploy carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from industrial sources | Environmental Scientist |
| **Protect and Restore Natural Carbon Sinks** | Preserve and expand forests, wetlands, and oceans that absorb carbon dioxide | Environmental Scientist |
| **Climate-Resilient Infrastructure** | Invest in infrastructure that can withstand impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and extreme weather events | Policy Maker |
| **Economic Incentives** | Implement carbon pricing mechanisms and offer subsidies for climate-friendly practices | Economist |
| **International Cooperation and Climate Governance** | Strengthen international agreements and encourage climate diplomacy and cooperation | Policy Maker |
| **Climate Education and Awareness** | Integrate climate education into school curricula and promote public awareness campaigns | Environmental Scientist |
| **Research and Development** | Continuously invest in climate-related research and development to improve understanding and develop new technologies | Economist |

**Implementation Timeline**
