## Test 1 
Llama3 8B Instruct

### Input: 
1. "Explain the causes of World War II
2. The prompt is too broad. It would be more effective to specify particular aspects of the causes
3. Outline the political and economic factors that led to the outbreak of World War II."

### Output:
Here is an outline of the political and economic factors that led to the outbreak of World War II:

**I. Political Factors**

A. Treaty of Versailles

* Harsh penalties and reparations imposed on Germany
* Germany's economy was severely damaged, leading to widespread resentment and a sense of injustice among the German people

B. Rise of Fascist and Nationalist Movements

* Nazi Party in Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, promised to restore Germany's economy and create jobs
* Fascist Italy, led by Benito Mussolini, sought to expand its empire in Africa and the Mediterranean
* Nationalist sentiment in Japan led to the expansion of its empire in East Asia

C. Appeasement Policy

* British and French governments sought to avoid another devastating war by appeasing Hitler's demands
* Failure of the League of Nations to effectively respond to Germany's aggression emboldened Hitler and allowed him to pursue his expansionist policies

**II. Economic Factors**

A. Global Economic Crisis

* Great Depression (1929-1939) led to widespread unemployment and economic devastation
* Rise of protectionism and trade wars between countries

B. German Economic Crisis

* Hyperinflation in the 1920s led to economic instability and widespread poverty
* Unemployment rates soared, leading to widespread discontent and support for extremist ideologies

C. Japanese Economic Expansion

* Japan's economy was struggling due to the Great Depression and the collapse of international trade
* Expansion into East Asia and Southeast Asia provided a solution to Japan's economic woes

**III. Convergence of Political and Economic Factors**

A. Hitler's Aggressive Expansion

* Hitler's aggressive expansionist policies, including the annexation of Austria and the invasion of Czechoslovakia, were driven by a desire to restore Germany's economy and create jobs
* Hitler's ideology of racial superiority and anti-Semitism, which led to the persecution of Jews and other minority groups, was also a factor

B. Japanese Aggression

* Japan's military expansion into East Asia and Southeast Asia was driven by a desire to secure resources and markets
* The Japanese military's aggression in China and Southeast Asia led to the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands imposing economic sanctions on Japan

C. Italian Aggression

* Italy's military expansion into Africa and the Mediterranean was driven by a desire to expand its empire and secure resources
* Mussolini's fascist regime sought to create a "New Roman Empire" and expand Italy's influence in Europe

The convergence of these political and economic factors created an environment in which war was increasingly likely. The aggressive expansion of Germany, Japan, and Italy, combined with the appeasement policy of Britain and France, ultimately led to the outbreak of World War II.
