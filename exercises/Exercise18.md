Is the AI bubble about to burst? Two years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, sparkling a surge in generative AI startups, China has now seen a wave of closures on AI companies. According to a report by Commercial Times, citing Chinese media TMTPost, nearly 80,000 AI companies in China have registered and then either closed down or suspended operations within the past 600 days.

The reports note that according to the data from the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System of China, between November 30, 2022, the release date of ChatGPT, and July 29, 2024, a total of 78,612 AI-related companies in China, which were newly registered during this period, are now in a deregistered or abnormal business status. This accounts for 8.9% of the 878,000 AI companies registered during the same period.

The current adversity for the AI companies in China, the reports suggest, could be attributed to excessive spendings regarding high computational costs and R&D investments, declines in venture capital leading to a funding freeze, and difficulties in achieving profitability.

According to the reports, over the past three years, more than 200,000 AI-related companies in China have been deregistered or revoked, with a total of 353,000 AI-related companies disappearing within the past decade.

On the other hand, as of August 7th, there are said to be 300,700 new AI companies registered in 2024. Currently, there are 1,804,300 AI-related companies in existence in China, the reports state.

Among them, over 4,500 companies are officially recognized as part of the AI industry system. More than 180 large generative AI models, which have completed registration and be online to provide public services, have been developed, with a registered user base exceeding 564 million.

Wang Xiaochuan, founder of Chinese search engine company Sogou, once stated in 2023 that the Large Language Model (LLM) for AI would undergo an “elimination tournament” in China, with the top tier likely consisting of no more than five companies, according to a report on Soho.

Baidu CEO Robin Li also mentioned in July that China has too many large language models, calling for tech leaders to focus more on building real-world applications driven by AI. A report by South China Morning Post, quoting Li, said that since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, China’s generative AI market has become crowded with over 200 large language models.
