### Input: 
Provide a brief summary of the effects of global warming.

### Output:
Global warming, also known as climate change, refers to the long-term rise in the average surface temperature of the Earth due to the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The main effects of global warming include:

1. Rising sea levels: As the polar ice caps and glaciers melt, sea levels rise, causing coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.
2. Extreme weather events: Global warming is linked to an increase in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall, which can have devastating impacts on human settlements and ecosystems.
3. Changes in precipitation patterns: Climate change alters the patterns of rainfall and snowfall, leading to droughts in some areas and floods in others, which can have significant impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human settlements.
4. Loss of biodiversity: Rising temperatures and changing environmental conditions are causing many species to migrate to new habitats or become extinct, leading to a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem disruption.
5. Melting of glaciers and polar ice caps: The melting of glaciers and polar ice caps is contributing to sea level rise and altering the global water cycle.
6. Increased risk of water scarcity: Climate change is altering the distribution and availability of freshwater resources, leading to water scarcity and competition for this precious resource.
7. Negative impacts on human health: Global warming is linked to an increase in heat-related illnesses, respiratory problems, and the spread of diseases, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children.
8. Economic impacts: Climate change is expected to have significant economic impacts, including damage to infrastructure, loss of productivity, and increased costs for healthcare and emergency response.

It's essential to note that these effects are not exhaustive, and the severity and frequency of these impacts will continue to worsen if global warming is not addressed through reduced greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable practices.

### Input: 
Provide a brief summary of the effects of global warming.
Max New Tokens from 2500 to 4096
Min New Tokens from 1 to 1000

### Output:
Global warming, caused by the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is leading to a range of severe consequences. Some of the most significant effects include:

* Rising sea levels and coastal erosion
* More frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall
* Changes in precipitation patterns, leading to droughts and floods
* Loss of biodiversity and extinction of many species
* Melting of glaciers and polar ice caps
* Increased risk of water scarcity and competition for this precious resource
* Negative impacts on human health, including heat-related illnesses and the spread of diseases
* Economic impacts, including damage to infrastructure, loss of productivity, and increased costs for healthcare and emergency response.

These effects are already being felt and will continue to worsen if global warming is not addressed through reduced greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable practices. It is essential to take immediate action to mitigate the effects of global warming and transition to a more sustainable future.
